## **To Begin**

Install npm dependencies locally by running:

`npm install`

Build the webpack bundle.js and watch for file changes:

`npm run build`

Then initiate the express server to listen on the specified port:

`npm start`

## **API**

Create a new root file 'token.js' and populate it with the same contents as provided in 'token.sample.js'.

Replace 'YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE' with a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

_Note: Confirm that 'token.js' is listed in the '.gitignore' root file so that it is never checked into Git. If the token becomes compromised, please revoke the token immediately and generate a new one._
